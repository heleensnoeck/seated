#Book a desk
 
##The client
The assignment comes from a company called Damco. Damco is a internation Danish company and 
specialized in logistics. 

##The assignment
Damco recently opend an office in the Netherlands (the Hague). In this office there are more employees then desks available. So there are people coming to the office for nothing. To avoid this, they asked me to develop a application. 

##The solution
I developed a application were employees can book a desk. My goal for this application was a simple interface that is fast to use and easy to understand. 

##The application
You cann see the application on this url: https://www.spotitshopit.com/damco


##Branches
I created a couple of branches with numbers here you wil find my process in code but also de design. 


###Branch 1. Show Ceren the concept
Build the webpage up. 

Feedback: Ceren would like to see:
-  Notifications so people know when desks are full for the day. 
-  I'm working at a fixed desk, but don't use my desk on Friday due to working at home. That is why I would like to make my desk available for others. Could you implement this in the application.
- It would be nice to see who booked a desk, so if somebody is not coming to the office but booked a desk we can say something about it.  

###Branch 2. Feedback week 2 
Feedback week 2:
-  I dont know that when i click on vacation i also have to go to the next page to actualy book the desk. 

After testing the app people did not get the interface so i decided to gut out the feathers and focus on the core concept people want to book a desk. In week 3 i build this. 

*Rewrite jquery to vanilla javascript  

###Master week 3&4 the final concept 

Build out the core concept with good code and slik design. 

Redone 
- Javascript
- Sass
- Html

##Tech i used in the app
- Html 
- Sass
- Css
- Javascript

The app is 100% responsive without media queries. The app works on ios devices. 
Further i made it possible to tab true the app you wont see the checkboxes light up, but when you use tab and your spacebar it will work fine. 

Then i got into Sass project building. I had to work with SASS at my internship. But i never know how the file structure worked, so i got into that ;) 

I also looked at color contrast this is also fine in the app.
